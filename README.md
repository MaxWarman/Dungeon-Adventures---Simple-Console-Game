# Dungeon-Adventures---Simple-Console-Game
It's my very first 'big' programming project. I decided to try making a console game and see how it's gonna work.

This project was inspired by classic (paper)RPG which could've been combined with a simple console technology and round based mechanics.
Whole project is written in c# and still in 'Pre-Alpha' version, but it's constantly getting developed. The main idea for now
is to write a working engine, with set of methods and commands, which can be easily implemented to every type of story author would like
to tell, starting from Dark-Fantasy Medival, finishing on Sci-Fi Space Opera...
