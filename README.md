# Dungeon Adventures - Simple Console Game
It's my very first 'big' programming project. I decided to try making a console, adventure game and test my programming skills at the same time. Also it's a great opportunity to learn basics of Github and to become more confident with open-source projects...

This project was inspired by classic (paper)RPG which could've been combined with a simple console technology and turn based mechanics.
Whole project is written in c# and still in 'Pre-Alpha' version - it's constantly being developed. The main idea for now
is to write a working engine, with set of methods and commands, which can be easily implemented to every type of story author would like
to tell, starting from Dark-Fantasy Medival, finishing on Sci-Fi Space Opera...
